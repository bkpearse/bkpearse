## About Me
I'm a data analyst hoping to morph into a ai engineer who loves building reliable systems, insightful dashboards, and developer tooling that makes teams faster. When I'm not automating workflows, you'll find me poring over football analytics, reading sci-fi, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.

- **FPL Insights** â€“ Terribly trying to find an edge.
- **n8n workflows** â€“ Hosting workflows, focused on automating mundane tasks and leveraging Gemini in google work spaces.

## Skills & Tools
- **Languages:** Python, SQL, TypeScript, Go (learning)
- **Data & Analytics:** dbt, DuckDB, Apache Superset, Metabase
- **Infrastructure & Automation:** Terraform, GitHub Actions, Docker, AWS, Azure
- **Collaboration:** Notion, Linear, Figma, Miro
